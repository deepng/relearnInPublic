Trying to practice my skills as I seek to improve myself

do run "cypress open" to enable cypress to add the default configurations

add the tests 

Cypress only uses css-selectors
Accessing elements using
id = #idNmae / tagName#className 
class = .className / tagName.className
others = tagname[] eg:tagname[type='search']
Parents = parentTagName childTagName

Cypress being a node project is asynchronos in nature, but cypress uses .then() function to make it synchronos
